Subject: Official Handover - "it's ouR Studio" Website (Proposed Remote Setup)

Hi Ma'am/Sir [Client's Name],

I'm so glad to hear that you're happy with the new website! As we discussed, I'm now ready to start the process of transferring full ownership of everything to you.

To make this **as easy and stress-free as possible**, I suggest we do a quick **"Remote Setup Session"** (via Zoom or Google Meet).

### How it works:
1.  We hop on a call and you share your screen.
2.  I can remotely guide or click through the technical setup steps on your computer.
3.  **Whenever a password or login is needed, you type it yourself.**
    *   This ensures I **never** see or handle your private passwords/business details.
    *   You keep full privacy while I handle the technical "heavy lifting."

### What we will accomplish (takes about 15-20 mins):
*   **Firebase Transfer:** Connecting the database to your Google Account.
*   **Hosting Transfer:** Moving the website hosting to your own account.
*   **Documentation:** I'll leave a copy of the manual and app files on your desktop.

This way, you don't have to worry about creating accounts or clicking the wrong buttons—we can get it all done in one go!

### Are you free sometime this week?
Let me know what time works best for you.

Best regards,
