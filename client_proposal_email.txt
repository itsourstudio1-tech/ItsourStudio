Subject: Hello from your former student developer — Hope you're doing well! 🌸

---

Hi Ma'am/Sir [Client's Name],

I hope this message finds you well! It's been about a year since our paths crossed during that school project, and I've been meaning to reach out. How has the studio been? I hope business has been flourishing — I still remember how warm and welcoming you were when we worked together.

I wanted to share a little story with you.

After we finished that website project for your studio last year, I found myself continuing to tinker with web development as a hobby. I genuinely enjoyed the experience of building something real for an actual business, and it sparked something in me. So, in my free time, I kept practicing — learning new technologies, experimenting with designs, and just trying to get better at my craft.

Here's where it gets a bit unexpected: as I was practicing, I ended up using "it's ouR Studio" as my sandbox project. I thought, "What better way to learn than to rebuild something I already care about?" What started as simple practice exercises somehow evolved into... well, a fully functional website.

I didn't plan for it to turn out this way, but I'm genuinely proud of how it came together

Compared to the original website we made for you (the one built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP), this new version has quite a few improvements:

✨ **Modern, Fluid Design** — The entire look and feel has been revamped with smooth animations, premium aesthetics, and a much more polished visual identity that I think really captures the vibe of the studio.

📱 **Fully Responsive** — It now works beautifully on all devices, from the smallest phones (down to 320px screens) to large desktops. No more awkward layouts on mobile!

⚡ **Smoother User Experience** — Page transitions are seamless, interactive elements feel alive, and the overall flow is much more intuitive for visitors browsing your packages or gallery.

🛠️ **Improved Admin Features** — There's now a proper admin dashboard where you can manage bookings, view customer feedback, update gallery images, and even see a calendar of scheduled sessions — all without touching any code.

💳 **Streamlined Booking & Payment Flow** — Customers can now book sessions, see real-time availability, and submit payment proof all in one smooth process.

🖼️ **Dynamic Gallery & Content** — You can easily add, remove, or update photos and content from the admin panel.

I'm not sure if you're currently looking for a website update or if you're happy with the current setup, but I wanted to offer this to you. Honestly, I built it out of genuine appreciation for that first experience working with you, and I'd be happy to hand it over if you find it useful.

If you're interested, I've also prepared a short document that walks through the website's features with screenshots 

Either way, I hope you're doing wonderfully, and I'd love to hear how things have been going at the studio!

Warm regards,
